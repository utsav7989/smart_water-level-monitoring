# smart_water-level-monitoring
This project monitors the water level in a tank and provides alerts to prevent overflow or shortage
# Smart Water Level Monitoring System using IoT

## 📌 Overview
This project monitors water tank levels using ultrasonic sensors and NodeMCU ESP8266. Data is sent to the Blynk app in real-time.

## 🔧 Components
- Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Jumper Wires
- Arduino IDE
- Blynk App

## ⚙️ How it works
1. Ultrasonic sensor detects water level
2. NodeMCU reads data and sends it over Wi-Fi
3. Blynk App displays real-time tank status
4. Alerts are triggered if tank is full/empty

## 🚀 How to Run
- Connect components as per circuit
- Upload code using Arduino IDE
- Configure Wi-Fi and Blynk token in code
- Power the NodeMCU and check the app

## 📌 Note
This is a prototype-level demo for IIT Patna / Microtek Project Board.
